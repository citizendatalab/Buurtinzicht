# ABOUT

Buurtinzicht is a concept developed to show how big data, social media analysis and participatory data can empower local urban communities.

Within the Buurtinzicht project we created a platform to show how big data, social media analysis and participatory data can empower local urban communities. We created a highly user friendly city-data dashboard that can be used by local community platforms in order to get meaningful (data) insights in order for them to make better, well informed decisions. We have successfully implemented our platform within a neighborhood community website (halloijburg.nl) and were able to provide meaningful insights by providing data and data visualizations on several themes.
